A useless and pointless version of tetris bound to make you lose your sanity. This game challenges your perspective on how you play games as well as dealing with the consequences in a brutal way. 

Tetris Champ

We’re in a world where playing useless and pointless games is the real deal and thus, the game “Tetris Champ” was born. 

The game has the weirdest controls which is being randomized every single round to any random letter in the alphabet. Forget using WASD or arrow keys to play your games and challenge it in a torturous way by using keys like q, k and any other not regularly used keys.

When we play games, we don't really tend to care about the consequences of our failure and that comes to a stop with “Tetris Champ.” Every single time you fail a round of this addictive yet raging game, you get slapped by a robotic hand with full force that you WILL feel.
